Math game I'm making as part of my D.T. coursework

When downloading the source code there are two files, 'MathGameUI.py' and 'MathGame.py'
- 'MathGameUI.py' is the one getting updated and has a GUI to interact with.
- When using 'MathGameUI.py' you can change the extention to a .pyw to remove the console.
- 'MathGame.py' is ran inside the console and is a very barebones version

  
If you are running 'MathGameUI.py' you will need these installed along with it:
-   pygame


# How to use
- If you load up 'MathGame.py' type in ? to see the commands

- When you load up 'MathGameUI.py' you will see a menu with a START button and a SEE ANSWERS button
- If SEE ANSWERS is pressed the hiscore will not update and next to the question the answer is visible
- When you're happy with your choice press START
- A question will appear and a keypad will appear. You can either tap the keypad or use your keyboard to press numbers. Press '=' or 'RETURN' to enter your answer.
- If you got the answer right +1 will be added to your score and the questions will get slightly harder
- If you get 3 questions wrong your hiscore will update and an ominous piece of music will play.

# Have fun!
If anyone doesn't like their stuff being on my repo i'll happily remove it :)
